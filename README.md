# Discord bot
This was a bot created to learn discord's api and get a feel for Go. It's highly specialized to things my friends and I specifically wanted it to do.

## Commands
`!get <query>`

Gets either a vocaloid song from the specified producer, or gets a random cover of the specified song.

`!snowflakerole <color> <name>`

Gives a role that has the specified color and name. The role doesn't confer any permissions and is entirely for aesthetics.

`!roulette`

Generates a 3x3 square of emotes.
